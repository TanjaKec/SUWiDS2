On the **22nd of April, 2020** <span style="color:green">**Subotica**</span> is joining the international conference [WiDS](https://www.widsconference.org). The [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](https://www.widsconference.org) initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. WiDS started as a conference at Stanford in November 2015. Now, <span style="color:green">**WiDS**</span> includes a global conference, with 150+ regional events worldwide including a [datathon](https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html) (encouraging participants to hone their skills) and a [podcast](https://www.widsconference.org/podcast.html) (featuring leaders in the field talking about their work, and their journeys). 

All genders are invited to attend <span style="color:green">**WiDS**</span> regional events, which feature outstanding women within the DS community. <span style="color:green">**WiDS Subotica**</span> welcomes anyone with an interest in DS. The goal is to promote DS, exchange knowledge and create a DS community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities and are welcome anyone interested in the field of DS. 

Our programme contains talks and workshops by data scientists and a panel discussion with women in data science focusing mainly on diversity and mentorship. The event will be hosted by [Valentina Đorđević
](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentina-%C4%91or%C4%91evi%C4%87/).

- **[Tijana Blagojev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tijana-blagojev-288b3442/)**: Coding, Tool for Assisting Media Policy Development

*<span style="color:gray">Nowadays, technological advances allow for large amount of information to be gathered and used for various purposes and there is an increasing need for interdisciplinarity. It is crucial that people with expertise in particular field are skilled in coding to conduct their own analysis as well as follow and monitor the work of others.  This presentation will focus on application of programming in R for media policy development. The Shiny web application for data on government funding of media in Serbia will serve as an example. It will also highlight the importance of reproducibility of research that could assist in finding better legislative solutions in the media sector.</span>*

- **[Željana Grbović](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeljana-grbovic-a73a55105/)**: Wheat ear automatic detection and counting in RGB and thermal images using deep learning

*<span style="color:gray">The number of farmers who use smart phones is increasing rapidly and furthermore RGB and thermal cameras are becoming more and more available either as smart phone gadgets or as integrated parts of the smart phone. Using them, farmers could have early information about the wheat yield. Currently, counting ears on part of a field and extrapolating the values for the whole field requires ears to be counted manually, which is prone to subjective evaluation, takes a lot of time and requires large human resources. In the case of larger fields, samples must be taken from more than one location, which additionally slows down the process. The aim of the research was to develop a system for wheat ear recognition and counting, which is necessary step for further estimation of wheat ear coverage density in the field, and yield prediction. Images of winter wheat were taken at 4 dates during the growing season and segmented manually to acquire the ground truth. Image segmentation was done using deep learning. Namely, convolutional neural networks were applied to RGB and thermal images and the results were compared to the ground truth to assess the system accuracy. Development of a comprehensive system for ear counting and yield prediction has a huge practical value for crop monitoring and optimal decision-making in wheat production.</span>*

She is highly interested in the application of machine learning algorithms and deep learning in the field of agriculture. She has expanded the field experiment on the wheat involving images from mobile phones to provide early prediction yield and automatic counted ears. Her main interests are image processing and application of transfer deep learning in plant phenotyping, food quality and safety. She is actively involved in few [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/sites/horizon2020/files/H2020_inBrief_EN_FinalBAT.pdf) projects including [ANTARES](ANTARES, Cybele and Dragon), [Cybele](https://www.cybele-project.eu) and Dragon.*
