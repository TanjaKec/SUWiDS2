On the **22nd of April, 2020** Subotica is joining the international conference [WiDS](https://www.widsconference.org). The [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](https://www.widsconference.org) initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. WiDS started as a conference at Stanford in November 2015. Now, <span style="color:green">**WiDS**</span> includes a global conference, with 150+ regional events worldwide including a [datathon](https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html) (encouraging participants to hone their skills) and a [podcast](https://www.widsconference.org/podcast.html) (featuring leaders in the field talking about their work, and their journeys). 

All genders are invited to attend <span style="color:green">**WiDS**</span> regional events, which feature outstanding women within the DS community. <span style="color:green">**WiDS Subotica**</span> welcomes anyone with an interest in DS. The goal is to promote DS, exchange knowledge and create a DS community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities and are welcome anyone interested in the field of DS. 

Our programme contains talks and workshops by data scientists and a panel discussion with women in data science focusing mainly on diversity and mentorship. The event will be hosted by [Valentina Đorđević
