      <description>We held WiDS2020 Subotica on 29-April-2020 as an online event. It featured outstanding women within the DS community.
Due to the situation regarding COVID-19 we had to move our event online with the programme containing five presentations by outstanding women directly engaged within the world of data science.
This year we were aiming to gather a number of women in DS not just from Serbia, but to connect regionally. We were also intending to engage with young women still attending local universities.</description>
