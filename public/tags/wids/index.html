<p>We held <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS2020 Subotica</strong></span> on 29-April-2020 as an online event. It featured outstanding women within the DS community.</p>
<p>Due to the situation regarding COVID-19 we had to move our event online with the programme containing five presentations by outstanding women directly engaged within the world of data science.</p>
<p>This year we were aiming to gather a number of women in DS not just from Serbia, but to connect regionally. We were also intending to engage with young women still attending local universities. However, despite not being able to go ahead with our originally planned programme, through this online event we have managed to bring together a number of inspirational women directly engaged with DS with in the region.</p>
<p>It has certainly motivated and galvanised us and we should build upon this to create a stronger regional community within the global <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS</strong></span>. It would provide us with the opportunity to outreach to women and young girls in more remote places within the region. <span style="color:green"><strong>Encouraging</strong></span>, <span style="color:green"><strong>inspiring</strong></span> and <span style="color:green"><strong>empowering</strong></span> them on their DS journeys are what we‚Äôre all about.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that we will meet up next year in a greater number and in happier circumstances.</p>
<p>If you were not able to join us on 29-April you can watch the full recording of the event available here <a href="https://youtu.be/ZcRUppF-qEk">üëâüé¶</a>.</p>

<p>On the <strong>29th of April, 2020</strong> <span style="color:green"><strong>Subotica</strong></span> is joining the international conference <a href="https://www.widsconference.org">WiDS</a>. The <a href="https://www.widsconference.org">Women in Data Science (WiDS)</a> initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. WiDS started as a conference at Stanford in November 2015. Now, <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS</strong></span> includes a global conference, with 150+ regional events worldwide including a <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html">datathon</a> (encouraging participants to hone their skills) and a <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/podcast.html">podcast</a> (featuring leaders in the field talking about their work, and their journeys).</p>
<p>All genders are invited to attend <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS</strong></span> regional events, which feature outstanding women within the DS community. <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS Subotica</strong></span> welcomes anyone with an interest in DS. The goal is to promote DS, exchange knowledge and create a DS community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities and are welcome anyone interested in the field of DS.</p>
<p><span style="color:green">Due to the situation regarding COVID-19 we have moved our even online with the programme containing five presentations by women directly engaged within the world of data science. The talks will provide an opportunity to hear about the advances and research in a number of data domains. Learn how leading women in data are advancing, and connect with potential mentors in the field.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="color:gray"> Using an example of fragrance industry data I will describe challenges of working with ‚Äúsmall data‚Äù. First challenge is gathering the data in unified way. I will tell about the results of client‚Äôs questionnaires and how important is a unified methodology of conducting those experiments. Second challenge is data cleaning - decisions made at this stage have a huge impact on a success and extendibility of the project. Last but not least is modelling sparse data, where a classical train/test split is no longer available. I will present pitfalls that we fell into and how we climb up from them.</span></em></p>

</ul>
<p><em><span style="color:gray">Regardless of the domain, working with large and complex datasets in order to find reliable and interpretable insights brings a lot of challenges. Building an efficient data processing pipeline can be a demanding task when computational and time resources are limited. Given such context, how can we, data-driven people, find a way to tackle our research or business goals? In this talk I will focus on the critical importance of feature preprocessing - the initial phase of data science projects. I will refer to the group project for The ABCD Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge and a few lessons learned from this competition.</span></em></p>

</ul>
<p><em><span style="color:gray">The number of farmers who use smart phones is increasing rapidly and furthermore RGB and thermal cameras are becoming more and more available either as smart phone gadgets or as integrated parts of the smart phone. Using them, farmers could have early information about the wheat yield. Currently, counting ears on part of a field and extrapolating the values for the whole field requires ears to be counted manually, which is prone to subjective evaluation, takes a lot of time and requires large human resources. In the case of larger fields, samples must be taken from more than one location, which additionally slows down the process. The aim of the research was to develop a system for wheat ear recognition and counting, which is necessary step for further estimation of wheat ear coverage density in the field, and yield prediction. Images of winter wheat were taken at 4 dates during the growing season and segmented manually to acquire the ground truth. Image segmentation was done using deep learning. Namely, convolutional neural networks were applied to RGB and thermal images and the results were compared to the ground truth to assess the system accuracy. Development of a comprehensive system for ear counting and yield prediction has a huge practical value for crop monitoring and optimal decision-making in wheat production.</span></em></p>
