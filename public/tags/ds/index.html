<p>On the <strong>22nd of April, 2020</strong> <span style="color:green"><strong>Subotica</strong></span> is joining the international conference <a href="https://www.widsconference.org">WiDS</a>. The <a href="https://www.widsconference.org">Women in Data Science (WiDS)</a> initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. WiDS started as a conference at Stanford in November 2015. Now, <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS</strong></span> includes a global conference, with 150+ regional events worldwide including a <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html">datathon</a> (encouraging participants to hone their skills) and a <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/podcast.html">podcast</a> (featuring leaders in the field talking about their work, and their journeys).</p>
<p>All genders are invited to attend <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS</strong></span> regional events, which feature outstanding women within the DS community. <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS Subotica</strong></span> welcomes anyone with an interest in DS. The goal is to promote DS, exchange knowledge and create a DS community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities and are welcome anyone interested in the field of DS.</p>
<p>Our programme contains talks and workshops by data scientists and a panel discussion with women in data science focusing mainly on diversity and mentorship. The event will be hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentina-%C4%91or%C4%91evi%C4%87/">Valentina Đorđević</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><em><span style="color:gray">The number of farmers who use smart phones is increasing rapidly and furthermore RGB and thermal cameras are becoming more and more available either as smart phone gadgets or as integrated parts of the smart phone. Using them, farmers could have early information about the wheat yield. Currently, counting ears on part of a field and extrapolating the values for the whole field requires ears to be counted manually, which is prone to subjective evaluation, takes a lot of time and requires large human resources. In the case of larger fields, samples must be taken from more than one location, which additionally slows down the process. The aim of the research was to develop a system for wheat ear recognition and counting, which is necessary step for further estimation of wheat ear coverage density in the field, and yield prediction. Images of winter wheat were taken at 4 dates during the growing season and segmented manually to acquire the ground truth. Image segmentation was done using deep learning. Namely, convolutional neural networks were applied to RGB and thermal images and the results were compared to the ground truth to assess the system accuracy. Development of a comprehensive system for ear counting and yield prediction has a huge practical value for crop monitoring and optimal decision-making in wheat production.</span></em></p>
