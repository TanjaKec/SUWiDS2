On the **22nd of April, 2020** Subotica is joining the international conference [WiDS](https://www.widsconference.org). The [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](https://www.widsconference.org) initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. WiDS started as a conference at Stanford in November 2015. Now, WiDS includes a global conference, with 150+ regional events worldwide including a [datathon](https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html) (encouraging participants to hone their skills) and a [podcast](https://www.widsconference.org/podcast.html) (featuring leaders in the field talking about their work, and their journeys). 

Our program contains talks and workshops by data scientists and a panel discussion with women in data science focusing mainly on diversity and mentorship.
