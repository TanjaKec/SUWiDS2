On the **29th of April, 2020** <span style="color:green">**Subotica**</span> is joining the international conference [WiDS](https://www.widsconference.org). The [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](https://www.widsconference.org) initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. WiDS started as a conference at Stanford in November 2015. Now, <span style="color:green">**WiDS**</span> includes a global conference, with 150+ regional events worldwide including a [datathon](https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html) (encouraging participants to hone their skills) and a [podcast](https://www.widsconference.org/podcast.html) (featuring leaders in the field talking about their work, and their journeys). 

All genders are invited to attend <span style="color:green">**WiDS**</span> regional events, which feature outstanding women within the DS community. <span style="color:green">**WiDS Subotica**</span> welcomes anyone with an interest in DS. The goal is to promote DS, exchange knowledge and create a DS community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities and are welcome anyone interested in the field of DS. 

<span style="color:green">Due to the situation regarding COVID-19 we have moved our even online with the programme containing five presentations by women directly engaged within the world of data science. The talks will provide an opportunity to hear about the advances and research in a number of data domains. Learn how leading women in data are advancing, and connect with potential mentors in the field.</span>

#### Speakers

<p></p>

- **[Maria Knorps](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-knorps/)**: Challenges of "small data"

*<span style="color:gray"> Using an example of fragrance industry data I will describe challenges of working with "small data". First challenge is gathering the data in unified way. I will tell about the results of client's questionnaires and how important is a unified methodology of conducting those experiments. Second challenge is data cleaning - decisions made at this stage have a huge impact on a success and extendibility of the project. Last but not least is modelling sparse data, where a classical train/test split is no longer available. I will present pitfalls that we fell into and how we climb up from them.</span>*

**Maria Knorps** *is a Data Scientist creating analytics, BI and machine learning solutions from the data collection to the web development. She combines scientific background (PhD in fluid mechanics) with several years of industry experience. Maria believes that simple solutions and clean code are at the center of well-designed applications, thus the growing interest in functional programming.*

- **[Tijana Blagojev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tijana-blagojev-288b3442/)**: Coding, Tool for Assisting Media Policy Development

*<span style="color:gray">Nowadays, technological advances allow for large amount of information to be gathered and used for various purposes and there is an increasing need for interdisciplinarity. It is crucial that people with expertise in particular field are skilled in coding to conduct their own analysis as well as follow and monitor the work of others. This presentation will focus on application of programming in R for media policy development, with practical examples of use of Shiny and flexdashboard packages. It will also highlight the importance of reproducibility of research that could assist in finding better legislative solutions in the media sector.</span>*

**Tijana Blagojev** *holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Politics, Big Data and Quantitative Methods from the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk). She is also a recipient of renowned [Chevening](https://www.chevening.org) scholarship that provided her with the opportunity to study in the UK. She absolutely loves R and wants to share her knowledge with people and students in Serbia. She is a coorganiser of [R-ladies Belgrade](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-belgrade/) chapter.*

- **[Å½eljana GrboviÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeljana-grbovic-a73a55105/)**: Wheat ear automatic detection and counting in RGB and thermal images using deep learning

*<span style="color:gray">The number of farmers who use smart phones is increasing rapidly and furthermore RGB and thermal cameras are becoming more and more available either as smart phone gadgets or as integrated parts of the smart phone. Using them, farmers could have early information about the wheat yield. Currently, counting ears on part of a field and extrapolating the values for the whole field requires ears to be counted manually, which is prone to subjective evaluation, takes a lot of time and requires large human resources. In the case of larger fields, samples must be taken from more than one location, which additionally slows down the process. The aim of the research was to develop a system for wheat ear recognition and counting, which is necessary step for further estimation of wheat ear coverage density in the field, and yield prediction. Images of winter wheat were taken at 4 dates during the growing season and segmented manually to acquire the ground truth. Image segmentation was done using deep learning. Namely, convolutional neural networks were applied to RGB and thermal images and the results were compared to the ground truth to assess the system accuracy. Development of a comprehensive system for ear counting and yield prediction has a huge practical value for crop monitoring and optimal decision-making in wheat production.</span>*

**Å½eljana GrboviÄ‡** *is a young researcher at [BioSense Institute](https://biosens.rs/?page_id=6597&lang=en) and PhD student in electrical engineering at [the University of Novi Sad](http://www.uns.ac.rs/index.php/en/). She is highly interested in the application of machine learning algorithms and deep learning in the field of agriculture. Her beginnings in machine learning started 2016 when her team ranked in the top 5 among 52 teams from 23 countries on prestigious competition [SP Cup organized by IEEE](https://www2.securecms.com/ICASSP2016/SPCup.asp). She received her masterâ€™s degree with the thesis about ear detection in wheat thermal images using deep neural networks. She has expanded the field experiment on the wheat involving images from mobile phones to provide early prediction yield and automatic counted ears. She is a guest researcher at [Wageningen University and Research (WUR)](https://wur.factcards.nl/) which is declared as the worldâ€™s best agricultural university for the fourth consecutive time. She is involved in Humistatus project about the prediction of spreading fungal infection on tomatoes based on hyperspectral images funded by the company [Green Yard](https://www.greenyard.group/) and [WUR](https://wur.factcards.nl/). She was a member of the team who tested [PerClass MIRA](https://www.perclass.com/apps/perclass-mira) Software for hyperspectral image processing before it is launched as public. She was involved in pilot project with [WUR](https://wur.factcards.nl/) Food safety on hyperspectral dataset of pig kidney images. Her main interests are image processing and application of transfer deep learning in plant phenotyping, food quality and safety. She is actively involved in few [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/sites/horizon2020/files/H2020_inBrief_EN_FinalBAT.pdf) projects including [ANTARES](ANTARES, Cybele and Dragon), [Cybele](https://www.cybele-project.eu) and Dragon.*
